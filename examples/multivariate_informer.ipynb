        "# Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Informer\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "A few months ago we introduced the [Time Series Transformer](https://huggingface.co/blog/time-series-transformers), which is the vanilla Transformer ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) applied to forecasting, and showed an example for the **univariate** probabilistic forecasting task (i.e. predicting each time series' 1-d distribution individually). In this post we introduce the _Informer_ model ([Zhou, Haoyi, et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436)), AAAI21 best paper which is [now available](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/informer) in ðŸ¤— Transformers. We will show how to use the Informer model for the **multivariate** probabilistic forecasting task, i.e., predicting the distribution of a future **vector** of time-series target values. Note that this will also work for the vanilla Time Series Transformer model.\n",
        "\n",
        "##  Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting\n",
        "\n",
        "As far as the modeling aspect of probabilistic forecasting is concerned, the Transformer/Informer will require no change when dealing with multivariate time series. In both the univariate and multivariate setting, the model will receive a sequence of vectors and thus the only change is on the output or emission side.\n",
        "\n",
        "Modeling the full joint conditional distribution of high dimensional data can get computationally expensive and thus methods resort to some approximation of the distribution, the easiest being to model the data as an independent distribution from the same family, or some low-rank approximation to the full covariance, etc. Here we will just resort to the independent (or diagonal) emissions which are supported for the families of distributions we have implemented [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/internal/time_series_utils).\n",

        "## Informer - Under The Hood\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on the vanilla Transformer ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)), Informer employs two major improvements. To understand these improvements, let's recall the drawbacks of the vanilla Transformer:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Quadratic computation of canonical self-attention:** The vanilla Transformer has a computational complexity of $O(T^2 D)$ where $T$ is the time series length and $D$ is the dimension of the hidden states. For long sequence time-series forecasting (also known as the _LSTF problem_), this might be really computationally expensive. To solve this problem, Informer employs a new self-attention mechanism called _ProbSparse_ attention, which has $O(T \\log T)$ time and space complexity.\n",
        "1. **Memory bottleneck when stacking layers:** When stacking $N$ encoder/decoder layers, the vanilla Transformer has a memory usage of $O(N T^2)$, which limits the model's capacity for long sequences. Informer uses a _Distilling_ operation, for reducing the input size between layers into its half slice. By doing so, it reduces the whole memory usage to be $O(N\\cdot T \\log T)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, the motivation for the Informer model is similar to Longformer ([Beltagy et el., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150)), Sparse Transformer ([Child et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509)) and other NLP papers for reducing the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism **when the input sequence is long**. Now, let's dive into _ProbSparse_ attention and the _Distilling_ operation with code examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ProbSparse Attention\n",
        "\n",
        "The main idea of ProbSparse is that the canonical self-attention scores form a long-tail distribution, where the \"active\" queries lie in the \"head\" scores and \"lazy\" queries lie in the \"tail\" area. By \"active\" query we mean a query $q_i$ such that the dot-product $\\langle q_i,k_i \\rangle$ **contributes** to the major attention, whereas a \"lazy\" query forms a dot-product which generates  **trivial** attention. Here, $q_i$ and $k_i$ are the $i$-th rows in $Q$ and $K$ attention matrices respectively.\n",

        "Given the idea of \"active\" and \"lazy\" queries, the ProbSparse attention selects the \"active\" queries, and creates a reduced query matrix $Q_{reduced}$ which is used to calculate the attention weights in $O(T \\log T)$. Let's see this more in detail with a code example.\n",

Note that in practice, the input length of queries and keys are typically equivalent in the self-attention computation, i.e. $L_Q = L_K = T$ where $T$ is the time series length. Therefore, the $QK^T$ multiplication takes $O(T^2 \\cdot d)$ computational complexity. In ProbSparse attention, our goal is to create a new $Q_{reduce}$ matrix and define:\n",

Since $Q_{reduce}$ selects only the Top $u$ queries, its size is $c\\cdot \\log L_Q \\times d$, so the multiplication $Q_{reduce}K^T$ takes only $O(L_K \\log L_Q) = O(T \\log T)$.\n",

        "Query Sparsity Measurement $M(q_i, K)$ is used for selecting the $u$ \"active\" queries $q_i$ in $Q$ to create $Q_{reduce}$. In theory, the dominant $\\langle q_i,k_i \\rangle$ pairs encourage the \"active\" $q_i$'s probability distribution **away** from the uniform distribution as can be seen in the figure below. Hence, the [KL divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the actual queries distribution and the uniform distribution is used to define the sparsity measurement.\n",
